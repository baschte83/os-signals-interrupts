# Signals and Interrupts

### Assignment, class and language
This is the solution to the assignment **Signals and Interrupts** of class **operating systems 1,** written in Python (2.7) with my two team members [Korbinian Karl](https://github.com/korbster) and [Ehsan Moslehi](https://github.com/eca852).

### Requirements
For this assignment we were given a working simulator to simulate scheduling in a modern operating system. The scheduler implemented in the simulator works with a **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)** algorithm. Our task was to understand the simulator and to reprogram the scheduler so that it works with a **Shortest-Job-First (SJF)** and after that with a **Shortest-Remaining-Time (SRT)** algorithm.

My main work was to understand, comment an reprogram the simulator.
